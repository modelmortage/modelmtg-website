# How Your Credit Score Impacts Your Mortgage Rate

Your credit score is one of the most important factors in determining your mortgage rate. Even a small difference in your score can mean thousands of dollars in interest over the life of your loan. Understanding this relationship empowers you to take action and potentially save significant money.

## What Is a Credit Score?

A credit score is a three-digit number (typically 300-850) that represents your creditworthiness. It's calculated based on your credit history and predicts how likely you are to repay borrowed money.

### The Three Major Credit Bureaus
- **Equifax**
- **Experian**
- **TransUnion**

Each bureau may have slightly different information, resulting in different scores.

### FICO Score vs. VantageScore

**FICO Score (most common for mortgages):**
- Range: 300-850
- Used by 90% of lenders
- Multiple versions (FICO 2, 4, 5 for mortgages)

**VantageScore:**
- Range: 300-850
- Less commonly used for mortgages
- Often seen on free credit monitoring sites

**Important:** The score you see on free sites may differ from what lenders see.

## Credit Score Ranges

### Exceptional (800-850)
- Best rates available
- Easiest approval
- Most loan options

### Very Good (740-799)
- Excellent rates
- Easy approval
- Wide range of options

### Good (670-739)
- Competitive rates
- Generally approved
- Good loan options

### Fair (580-669)
- Higher rates
- May need larger down payment
- Limited loan options
- FHA loans available

### Poor (300-579)
- Highest rates or denial
- Very limited options
- May need 10% down for FHA
- Consider credit repair first

## How Credit Scores Affect Mortgage Rates

Lenders use risk-based pricing: lower risk (higher scores) = lower rates.

### Rate Differences by Credit Score

**Example: $300,000 30-year fixed-rate mortgage**

| Credit Score | Interest Rate | Monthly Payment | Total Interest |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 760-850 | 6.5% | $1,896 | $382,633 |
| 700-759 | 6.75% | $1,946 | $400,560 |
| 680-699 | 6.875% | $1,971 | $409,560 |
| 660-679 | 7.0% | $1,996 | $418,527 |
| 640-659 | 7.25% | $2,047 | $436,920 |
| 620-639 | 7.625% | $2,125 | $465,000 |

**Key Takeaway:** A 760 score vs. 620 score saves:
- $229/month
- $2,748/year
- $82,367 over 30 years

## What Factors Determine Your Credit Score?

### 1. Payment History (35%)
**Most important factor**

- On-time payments: Positive impact
- Late payments: Negative impact (30, 60, 90+ days)
- Collections, charge-offs, bankruptcies: Severe impact

**Impact duration:**
- Late payments: 7 years
- Bankruptcies: 7-10 years
- Foreclosures: 7 years

### 2. Credit Utilization (30%)
**Second most important**

Percentage of available credit you're using.

**Formula:** Total balances ÷ Total credit limits

**Example:**
- Credit card limit: $10,000
- Current balance: $3,000
- Utilization: 30%

**Ideal utilization:**
- Below 30% overall
- Below 10% for best scores
- 0% is not necessary

**Quick wins:**
- Pay down balances
- Request credit limit increases
- Spread balances across cards

### 3. Length of Credit History (15%)
Average age of all your credit accounts.

**Factors:**
- Age of oldest account
- Age of newest account
- Average age of all accounts

**Tips:**
- Keep old accounts open
- Don't close unused cards (unless fees apply)
- Become authorized user on old accounts

### 4. Credit Mix (10%)
Variety of credit types you manage.

**Types:**
- Revolving: Credit cards, lines of credit
- Installment: Auto loans, student loans, mortgages
- Open: Utility accounts, cell phone contracts

**Note:** Don't open accounts just for mix; it's a minor factor.

### 5. New Credit (10%)
Recent credit applications and new accounts.

**Hard inquiries:**
- Occur when you apply for credit
- Remain on report for 2 years
- Impact score for 12 months
- Multiple inquiries for same purpose (mortgage shopping) count as one if within 14-45 days

**Soft inquiries:**
- Checking your own credit
- Pre-approval offers
- Employment checks
- Don't affect your score

## Minimum Credit Scores by Loan Type

### Conventional Loans
- **Minimum:** 620
- **Recommended:** 680+
- **Best rates:** 740+

### FHA Loans
- **3.5% down:** 580+
- **10% down:** 500-579
- **Recommended:** 620+

### VA Loans
- **No VA minimum:** Lender-dependent
- **Typical lender minimum:** 620
- **Recommended:** 640+

### USDA Loans
- **Minimum:** 640
- **Recommended:** 660+

### Jumbo Loans
- **Minimum:** 700
- **Recommended:** 740+

## Credit Score Myths

### Myth 1: "Checking my credit hurts my score"
**Reality:** Checking your own credit is a soft inquiry and doesn't affect your score.

### Myth 2: "Closing credit cards improves my score"
**Reality:** Usually hurts your score by reducing available credit and potentially shortening credit history.

### Myth 3: "Carrying a balance helps my score"
**Reality:** You don't need to carry a balance or pay interest to build credit. Pay in full each month.

### Myth 4: "I only have one credit score"
**Reality:** You have multiple scores from different bureaus and scoring models.

### Myth 5: "Income affects my credit score"
**Reality:** Income doesn't directly affect your score, though it affects your ability to get credit.

### Myth 6: "Paying off collections removes them"
**Reality:** Paid collections remain on your report for 7 years, though impact lessens over time.

## When to Check Your Credit

### Before Applying for a Mortgage (6-12 months out)
- Identify issues to address
- Dispute errors
- Create improvement plan

### During Mortgage Shopping (30-45 days)
- Multiple mortgage inquiries count as one
- Shop rates without fear

### Regularly Throughout Life
- Monitor for identity theft

**Free resources:**

## Working with Lenders

### Be Honest About Your Credit
Lenders will pull your credit anyway. Honesty helps them:
- Recommend appropriate loan programs
- Set realistic expectations
- Suggest improvement strategies

### Ask About Credit Score Requirements
Different lenders have different overlays (requirements beyond minimum).

### Consider Manual Underwriting
If you have limited credit history but strong finances:
- FHA allows manual underwriting
- VA allows manual underwriting
- Some conventional programs available

**Key takeaways:**
- Check your credit early (6-12 months before buying)
- Focus on payment history and utilization
- Dispute errors immediately
- Pay down credit card balances
- Maintain old accounts
