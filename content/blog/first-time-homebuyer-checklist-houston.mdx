# First-Time Homebuyer Checklist for Houston

Buying your first home in Houston is an exciting milestone, but it can also feel overwhelming. The Houston real estate market has unique characteristics that first-time buyers need to understand. This comprehensive checklist will guide you through every step of the process, from financial preparation to closing day.

## Why Houston Is Great for First-Time Buyers

Houston offers several advantages for first-time homebuyers:

- **No State Income Tax:** More money in your pocket for savings and mortgage payments
- **Affordable Housing:** Compared to other major metros, Houston offers excellent value
- **Strong Job Market:** Diverse economy with opportunities in energy, healthcare, aerospace, and tech
- **No Zoning Laws:** Unique flexibility in property development and neighborhood character
- **Growing Communities:** New developments and established neighborhoods to choose from

## 6-12 Months Before Buying

### 1. Check and Improve Your Credit Score

Your credit score significantly impacts your mortgage rate and loan approval.

**Action steps:**
- Pull your free credit reports from all three bureaus (AnnualCreditReport.com)
- Review for errors and dispute any inaccuracies
- Pay down credit card balances below 30% utilization
- Make all payments on time
- Avoid opening new credit accounts

**Houston tip:** Many Houston lenders offer first-time buyer programs with flexible credit requirements, but better credit always means better rates.

### 2. Save for Your Down Payment and Closing Costs

**Down payment options:**
- Conventional: 3-5% minimum
- FHA: 3.5% minimum
- VA: 0% (for eligible veterans)
- USDA: 0% (for eligible rural/suburban areas)

**Closing costs:** Budget 2-5% of purchase price
- Typical on a $300,000 home: $6,000-$15,000

**Houston-specific costs to consider:**
- Property taxes (higher than national average, but no state income tax)
- Homeowners insurance (factor in hurricane/flood coverage)
- HOA fees (common in newer developments)

### 3. Research Houston Neighborhoods

Houston is massive (665 square miles!) with distinct neighborhoods offering different lifestyles and price points.

**Popular areas for first-time buyers:**

**Inside the Loop:**
- Heights: Historic charm, walkability, trendy restaurants
- Montrose: Arts district, diverse, central location
- EaDo: Up-and-coming, affordable, close to downtown

**Outside the Loop:**
- Katy: Excellent schools, family-friendly, newer construction
- Sugar Land: Master-planned communities, top-rated schools
- The Woodlands: Suburban amenity, parks, good schools
- Pearland: Affordable, growing, good schools

**Consider:**
- Commute time (Houston traffic is real!)
- School districts (even if you don't have kids, it affects resale)
- Flood zones (critical in Houston)
- Future development plans
- Property tax rates (vary by area)

### 4. Understand Houston's Flood Risk

Houston's flat terrain and proximity to the Gulf make flooding a serious consideration.

**Action steps:**
- Check FEMA flood maps for any property you consider
- Understand the difference between 100-year and 500-year flood plains
- Budget for flood insurance if required (or recommended)
- Ask about property's flood history
- Consider elevation and drainage

**Post-Harvey reality:** Many buyers now prioritize flood risk even more heavily.

## 3-6 Months Before Buying

### 5. Get Pre-Approved for a Mortgage

Pre-approval shows sellers you're a serious buyer and helps you understand your budget.

**Documents you'll need:**
- Last 2 years of tax returns
- Last 2 months of bank statements
- Recent pay stubs
- W-2s from past 2 years
- Photo ID
- List of debts and assets

**Houston lenders to consider:**
- Local mortgage brokers (like Model Mortgage!)
- Credit unions
- National banks
- Online lenders

**Pro tip:** Get quotes from at least 3 lenders to compare rates and fees.

### 6. Find a Real Estate Agent

A good buyer's agent is invaluable, especially in Houston's competitive market.

**Look for:**
- Experience with first-time buyers
- Knowledge of your target neighborhoods
- Strong negotiation skills
- Availability and responsiveness
- HAR (Houston Association of Realtors) membership

**Questions to ask:**
- How many first-time buyers have you worked with?
- What's your average time to close?
- How do you handle multiple offer situations?
- What's your communication style?

### 7. Determine Your Must-Haves vs. Nice-to-Haves

**Must-haves might include:**
- Number of bedrooms/bathrooms
- Maximum commute time
- School district quality
- Flood zone status
- Garage space (important in Houston heat!)
- Outdoor space

**Nice-to-haves might include:**
- Updated kitchen
- Pool
- Home office
- Walk-in closets
- Smart home features

## 1-3 Months Before Buying

### 8. Start House Hunting

**Houston-specific tips:**
- Start your search on HAR.com (Houston Association of Realtors' official site)
- Attend open houses to get a feel for different areas
- Drive neighborhoods at different times of day
- Check commute times during rush hour
- Visit on weekends to see neighborhood activity

**Red flags to watch for:**
- Foundation issues (common in Houston's clay soil)
- Roof condition (important for hurricane season)
- HVAC age (critical in Houston's heat)
- Drainage problems
- Outdated electrical (especially in older homes)

### 9. Make an Offer

When you find the right home, your agent will help you craft a competitive offer.

**Houston market considerations:**
- Market is often competitive for well-priced homes
- Be prepared to act quickly
- Consider escalation clauses in multiple offer situations
- Seller concessions are negotiable
- Inspection contingencies are standard

**Typical offer includes:**
- Purchase price
- Earnest money (1-2% of purchase price)
- Financing contingency
- Inspection contingency
- Appraisal contingency
- Closing date

### 10. Home Inspection

**Critical in Houston due to:**
- Foundation issues from soil movement
- Roof damage from storms
- HVAC problems from constant use
- Plumbing issues
- Drainage concerns

**Inspection should cover:**
- Foundation and structure
- Roof
- HVAC systems
- Plumbing and electrical
- Drainage and grading
- Pest inspection (termites are common)

**Budget:** $400-$600 for standard inspection

### 11. Appraisal

Your lender will order an appraisal to ensure the home's value supports the loan amount.

**If appraisal comes in low:**
- Negotiate with seller to lower price
- Bring additional cash to closing
- Challenge the appraisal with comparable sales
- Walk away (if you have appraisal contingency)

## Final Month Before Closing

### 12. Finalize Your Mortgage

**Stay in close contact with your lender:**
- Respond quickly to document requests
- Don't make large purchases
- Don't change jobs
- Don't open new credit accounts
- Keep your finances stable

### 13. Get Homeowners Insurance

**Houston-specific considerations:**
- Wind/hail coverage (separate from standard policy)
- Flood insurance (if in flood zone or recommended)
- Higher premiums due to hurricane risk
- Deductibles (often percentage-based for wind/hail)

**Shop around:** Rates vary significantly between insurers.

### 14. Final Walkthrough

24-48 hours before closing, do a final walkthrough to ensure:
- Agreed-upon repairs were completed
- Property is in same condition as when you made offer
- All fixtures and appliances included in sale are present
- No new damage has occurred

## Closing Day

### 15. Review Closing Disclosure

You'll receive this at least 3 days before closing. Review carefully:
- Loan terms match what you agreed to
- Closing costs are accurate
- No unexpected fees

### 16. Bring Required Items to Closing

- Photo ID
- Cashier's check or wire transfer confirmation for closing costs
- Proof of homeowners insurance
- Any additional documents your lender requires

### 17. Sign Documents and Get Your Keys!

You'll sign numerous documents including:
- Promissory note
- Deed of trust
- Closing disclosure
- Title documents
- HOA documents (if applicable)

**Congratulations – you're now a Houston homeowner!**

## After Closing

- Gas
- Internet/cable
- Trash service

### Change Your Address
- USPS forwarding
- Driver's license
- Voter registration
