# How Much House Can I Afford? A Complete Affordability Guide

One of the first questions every homebuyer asks is: "How much house can I afford?" The answer depends on several factors including your income, debts, down payment, and the type of loan you choose. Understanding these factors helps you set a realistic budget and avoid becoming house poor.

## The Quick Answer: The 28/36 Rule

Financial experts traditionally recommend the 28/36 rule:

- **28%:** Your monthly housing costs shouldn't exceed 28% of your gross monthly income
- **36%:** Your total monthly debt payments (including housing) shouldn't exceed 36% of your gross monthly income

**Example:**
- Gross monthly income: $6,000
- Maximum housing payment (28%): $1,680
- Maximum total debt payments (36%): $2,160

## What's Included in Your Housing Payment?

Your monthly housing payment includes more than just principal and interest. Lenders use PITI:

- **P**rincipal: The amount you borrowed
- **I**nterest: The cost of borrowing
- **T**axes: Property taxes
- **I**nsurance: Homeowners insurance and mortgage insurance (if applicable)

Some payments also include:
- HOA fees
- Special assessments
- Utilities (for some loan programs)

## Key Factors That Determine Affordability

### 1. Your Income
Lenders look at your gross monthly income from all sources:
- Salary or wages
- Bonuses and commissions
- Self-employment income
- Rental income
- Retirement income
- Alimony or child support

**Stability matters:** Lenders prefer consistent, documented income over two years.

### 2. Your Debts
Lenders calculate your debt-to-income ratio (DTI) by dividing your monthly debt payments by your gross monthly income.

**Debts included:**
- Credit card minimum payments
- Auto loans
- Student loans
- Personal loans
- Other mortgages
- Alimony or child support payments

**Debts NOT included:**
- Utilities
- Insurance (except mortgage insurance)
- Groceries
- Entertainment

### 3. Your Down Payment
A larger down payment means:
- Smaller loan amount
- Lower monthly payment
- Better interest rates
- No PMI (if 20% or more)
- More home for your budget

**Down payment options:**
- Conventional: 3-20%
- FHA: 3.5%
- VA: 0%
- USDA: 0%

### 4. Your Credit Score
Higher credit scores qualify for better interest rates, which directly affects affordability.

**Rate impact example ($300,000 loan, 30 years):**
- 760+ credit score, 6.5% rate: $1,896/month
- 680 credit score, 7.0% rate: $1,996/month
- Difference: $100/month or $36,000 over 30 years

### 5. Interest Rates
Even small rate differences significantly impact affordability.

**Example ($300,000 loan, 30 years):**
- 6.0% rate: $1,799/month
- 6.5% rate: $1,896/month
- 7.0% rate: $1,996/month

### 6. Loan Term
Shorter terms mean higher monthly payments but less total interest.

**Example ($300,000 loan, 6.5% rate):**
- 30-year term: $1,896/month, $382,633 total interest
- 15-year term: $2,613/month, $170,351 total interest
- Savings: $212,282 in interest

## Calculating Your Maximum Home Price

### Step 1: Calculate Your Maximum Monthly Payment
Gross monthly income × 28% = Maximum housing payment

**Example:**
$6,000 × 0.28 = $1,680 maximum housing payment

### Step 2: Subtract Property Taxes and Insurance
Estimated property taxes and insurance vary by location and home value.

**Example:**
- Maximum payment: $1,680
- Property taxes: $300/month
- Homeowners insurance: $100/month
- Available for P&I: $1,280/month

### Step 3: Calculate Maximum Loan Amount
Use a mortgage calculator or formula to determine the loan amount that results in your available P&I payment.

**Example ($1,280/month P&I, 6.5% rate, 30 years):**
Maximum loan amount: ~$203,000

### Step 4: Add Your Down Payment
Maximum loan + Down payment = Maximum home price

**Example:**
- Maximum loan: $203,000
- Down payment (10%): $22,556
- Maximum home price: $225,556

## Beyond the Numbers: Other Affordability Considerations

### 1. Emergency Fund
Maintain 3-6 months of expenses in savings after your down payment and closing costs.

### 2. Home Maintenance Costs
Budget 1-2% of home value annually for maintenance and repairs.

**Example ($250,000 home):**
$2,500-$5,000/year or $208-$417/month

### 3. Utilities
Larger homes mean higher utility costs. Budget accordingly.

### 4. Lifestyle and Goals
Consider:
- Retirement savings
- Children's education
- Travel and entertainment
- Career changes
- Future family plans

### 5. Market Conditions
In competitive markets, you may need to stretch your budget or compromise on features.

## Different Loan Types, Different Affordability

### Conventional Loans
- DTI up to 43% (sometimes 50%)
- Credit score 620+
- Down payment 3-20%

### FHA Loans
- DTI up to 43% (sometimes higher)
- Credit score 580+
- Down payment 3.5%
- Mortgage insurance required

### VA Loans
- DTI up to 41% (sometimes higher)
- No minimum credit score (lender-dependent)
- No down payment
- No mortgage insurance
- Residual income requirements

### USDA Loans
- DTI up to 41%
- Credit score 640+
- No down payment
- Income limits apply

## How to Increase Your Affordability

### 1. Improve Your Credit Score
- Pay bills on time
- Reduce credit card balances
- Don't open new credit accounts
- Dispute credit report errors

### 2. Reduce Your Debts
- Pay off credit cards
- Pay down auto loans
- Consolidate high-interest debt
- Avoid new debt

### 3. Increase Your Income
- Ask for a raise
- Take on a side job
- Include all eligible income sources
- Document bonuses and commissions

### 4. Save a Larger Down Payment
- Reduces loan amount
- Lowers monthly payment
- May eliminate PMI
- Improves interest rate

### 5. Consider a Co-Borrower
Adding a co-borrower with income can increase your buying power, but both parties are equally responsible for the loan.

### 6. Shop for Better Rates
Even 0.25% can make a difference. Compare offers from multiple lenders.

## The Danger of Overextending

Just because you qualify for a certain amount doesn't mean you should borrow it. Consider:

**House Poor:** Spending so much on housing that you can't afford other necessities or goals.

**Warning signs:**
- No money for savings
- Can't afford home maintenance
- Struggling with other bills
- No emergency fund
- Constant financial stress

## Conclusion

Determining how much house you can afford requires careful consideration of your income, debts, down payment, and financial goals. While lenders use the 28/36 rule as a guideline, your personal comfort level and lifestyle should ultimately guide your decision.

Remember: The goal isn't to buy the most expensive house you qualify for—it's to buy a home you can comfortably afford while maintaining your financial health and achieving your other life goals.
