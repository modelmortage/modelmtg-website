# Understanding Closing Costs: What to Expect When Buying a Home

Closing costs are one of the biggest surprises for first-time homebuyers. Beyond your down payment, you'll need to budget for various fees and expenses that can add up to 2-5% of your home's purchase price. Understanding these costs helps you budget accurately and avoid last-minute surprises.

## What Are Closing Costs?

Closing costs are fees and expenses you pay when finalizing your home purchase. They cover services and processes required to complete the transaction, from loan origination to title insurance to government recording fees.

## How Much Are Closing Costs?

**Typical range:** 2-5% of the home's purchase price

**Examples:**
- $200,000 home: $4,000-10,000
- $300,000 home: $6,000-15,000
- $400,000 home: $8,000-20,000

**Factors affecting costs:**
- Home price
- Location
- Loan type
- Lender fees
- Property taxes
- Title insurance rates

## Breakdown of Common Closing Costs

### Loan-Related Fees

#### 1. Loan Origination Fee (0.5-1% of loan amount)
Covers the lender's cost to process your loan application.

**Example:** $300,000 loan × 1% = $3,000

**Negotiable:** Sometimes, especially with competing offers

#### 2. Discount Points (Optional)
Pay upfront to lower your interest rate. One point = 1% of loan amount, typically reduces rate by 0.25%.

**Example:**
- $300,000 loan
- 1 point = $3,000
- Rate reduction: 6.5% to 6.25%
- Monthly savings: ~$50
- Break-even: 60 months

**Worth it if:** You plan to stay in the home long-term

#### 3. Application Fee ($75-300)
Covers initial processing of your loan application.

**Sometimes waived:** Shop around

#### 4. Underwriting Fee ($300-900)
Covers the cost of reviewing and verifying your financial information.

#### 5. Processing Fee ($300-500)
Administrative costs for handling your loan paperwork.

### Third-Party Fees

#### 6. Appraisal Fee ($300-600)
Required by lender to determine home's market value.

**Paid upfront:** Usually at time of order
**Non-refundable:** Even if deal falls through

Not required but highly recommended. Identifies potential problems with the property.

**Additional inspections:**
- Termite: $75-150
- Radon: $150-300
- Sewer: $200-400
- Mold: $300-1,000

#### 8. Credit Report Fee ($25-50)

#### 9. Flood Certification ($15-25)
Determines if property is in a flood zone.

#### 10. Survey Fee ($300-500)
Verifies property boundaries and legal description.

### Title and Legal Fees

#### 11. Title Search ($200-400)
Review of public records to ensure seller has legal right to sell and there are no liens.

#### 12. Title Insurance
Protects against future claims to ownership.

- **Lender's Policy (Required):** Protects the lender. Cost based on loan amount.
- **Owner's Policy (Optional but Recommended):** Protects you. Cost based on home price. Often paid by seller in some regions.

#### 13. Settlement/Closing Fee ($300-500)

#### 15. Recording Fees ($50-250)

### Prepaids and Escrow

#### 16. Property Taxes
Often 2-6 months of taxes collected upfront to fund your escrow account.

#### 17. Homeowners Insurance
Usually 1 year of premiums paid upfront + 2-3 months for escrow.

#### 18. Prepaid Interest
Daily interest from hearing date until first of next month.

**Example:** Close on 15th, pay 15 days of interest.

#### 19. Mortgage Insurance (if applicable)
- **FHA:** 1.75% Upfront Mortgage Insurance Premium (UFMIP) often added to loan balance.
- **VA:** Funding Fee (1.25-3.3%) often added to loan balance.
- **Conventional:** Upfront PMI (rare, usually monthly).

## How to Reduce Closing Costs

1. **Shop Around:** Get Loan Estimates from 3-5 lenders and compare "Loan Costs."
2. **Negotiate Lender Fees:** Ask to waive application or processing fees.
3. **Ask for Seller Concessions:** Seller can pay up to 3-6% of closing costs (depending on loan type).
4. **Close at End of Month:** Reduces prepaid interest charges.
5. **Shop for Services:** You can choose your own pest inspector or survey company in some cases.
6. **Ask About Reissue Rates:** If refinancing or buying a recently sold home, ask for discounted title insurance.

## Conclusion

Closing costs are a necessary part of buying a home, but they shouldn't be a mystery. By understanding these fees and shopping around, you can budget effectively and potentially save thousands.

Remember to review your Closing Disclosure carefully at least 3 days before closing to ensure it matches your Loan Estimate.
