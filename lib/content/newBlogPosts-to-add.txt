# First-Time Homebuyer Checklist for Houston

Buying your first home in Houston is an exciting milestone, but it can also feel overwhelming. The Houston real estate market has unique characteristics that first-time buyers need to understand. This comprehensive checklist will guide you through every step of the process, from financial preparation to closing day.

## Why Houston Is Great for First-Time Buyers

Houston offers several advantages for first-time homebuyers:

- **No State Income Tax:** More money in your pocket for savings and mortgage payments
- **Affordable Housing:** Compared to other major metros, Houston offers excellent value
- **Strong Job Market:** Diverse economy with opportunities in energy, healthcare, aerospace, and tech
- **No Zoning Laws:** Unique flexibility in property development and neighborhood character
- **Growing Communities:** New developments and established neighborhoods to choose from

## 6-12 Months Before Buying

### 1. Check and Improve Your Credit Score

Your credit score significantly impacts your mortgage rate and loan approval.

**Action steps:**
- Pull your free credit reports from all three bureaus (AnnualCreditReport.com)
- Review for errors and dispute any inaccuracies
- Pay down credit card balances below 30% utilization
- Make all payments on time
- Avoid opening new credit accounts

**Houston tip:** Many Houston lenders offer first-time buyer programs with flexible credit requirements, but better credit always means better rates.

### 2. Save for Your Down Payment and Closing Costs

**Down payment options:**
- Conventional: 3-5% minimum
- FHA: 3.5% minimum
- VA: 0% (for eligible veterans)
- USDA: 0% (for eligible rural/suburban areas)

**Closing costs:** Budget 2-5% of purchase price
- Typical on a $300,000 home: $6,000-$15,000

**Houston-specific costs to consider:**
- Property taxes (higher than national average, but no state income tax)
- Homeowners insurance (factor in hurricane/flood coverage)
- HOA fees (common in newer developments)

### 3. Research Houston Neighborhoods

Houston is massive (665 square miles!) with distinct neighborhoods offering different lifestyles and price points.

**Popular areas for first-time buyers:**

**Inside the Loop:**
- Heights: Historic charm, walkability, trendy restaurants
- Montrose: Arts district, diverse, central location
- EaDo: Up-and-coming, affordable, close to downtown

**Outside the Loop:**
- Katy: Excellent schools, family-friendly, newer construction
- Sugar Land: Master-planned communities, top-rated schools
- The Woodlands: Suburban amenity, parks, good schools
- Pearland: Affordable, growing, good schools

**Consider:**
- Commute time (Houston traffic is real!)
- School districts (even if you don't have kids, it affects resale)
- Flood zones (critical in Houston)
- Future development plans
- Property tax rates (vary by area)

### 4. Understand Houston's Flood Risk

Houston's flat terrain and proximity to the Gulf make flooding a serious consideration.

**Action steps:**
- Check FEMA flood maps for any property you consider
- Understand the difference between 100-year and 500-year flood plains
- Budget for flood insurance if required (or recommended)
- Ask about property's flood history
- Consider elevation and drainage

**Post-Harvey reality:** Many buyers now prioritize flood risk even more heavily.

## 3-6 Months Before Buying

### 5. Get Pre-Approved for a Mortgage

Pre-approval shows sellers you're a serious buyer and helps you understand your budget.

**Documents you'll need:**
- Last 2 years of tax returns
- Last 2 months of bank statements
- Recent pay stubs
- W-2s from past 2 years
- Photo ID
- List of debts and assets

**Houston lenders to consider:**
- Local mortgage brokers (like Model Mortgage!)
- Credit unions
- National banks
- Online lenders

**Pro tip:** Get quotes from at least 3 lenders to compare rates and fees.

### 6. Find a Real Estate Agent

A good buyer's agent is invaluable, especially in Houston's competitive market.

**Look for:**
- Experience with first-time buyers
- Knowledge of your target neighborhoods
- Strong negotiation skills
- Availability and responsiveness
- HAR (Houston Association of Realtors) membership

**Questions to ask:**
- How many first-time buyers have you worked with?
- What's your average time to close?
- How do you handle multiple offer situations?
- What's your communication style?

### 7. Determine Your Must-Haves vs. Nice-to-Haves

**Must-haves might include:**
- Number of bedrooms/bathrooms
- Maximum commute time
- School district quality
- Flood zone status
- Garage space (important in Houston heat!)
- Outdoor space

**Nice-to-haves might include:**
- Updated kitchen
- Pool
- Home office
- Walk-in closets
- Smart home features

## 1-3 Months Before Buying

### 8. Start House Hunting

**Houston-specific tips:**
- Start your search on HAR.com (Houston Association of Realtors' official site)
- Attend open houses to get a feel for different areas
- Drive neighborhoods at different times of day
- Check commute times during rush hour
- Visit on weekends to see neighborhood activity

**Red flags to watch for:**
- Foundation issues (common in Houston's clay soil)
- Roof condition (important for hurricane season)
- HVAC age (critical in Houston's heat)
- Drainage problems
- Outdated electrical (especially in older homes)

### 9. Make an Offer

When you find the right home, your agent will help you craft a competitive offer.

**Houston market considerations:**
- Market is often competitive for well-priced homes
- Be prepared to act quickly
- Consider escalation clauses in multiple offer situations
- Seller concessions are negotiable
- Inspection contingencies are standard

**Typical offer includes:**
- Purchase price
- Earnest money (1-2% of purchase price)
- Financing contingency
- Inspection contingency
- Appraisal contingency
- Closing date

### 10. Home Inspection

**Critical in Houston due to:**
- Foundation issues from soil movement
- Roof damage from storms
- HVAC problems from constant use
- Plumbing issues
- Drainage concerns

**Inspection should cover:**
- Foundation and structure
- Roof
- HVAC systems
- Plumbing and electrical
- Drainage and grading
- Pest inspection (termites are common)

**Budget:** $400-$600 for standard inspection

### 11. Appraisal

Your lender will order an appraisal to ensure the home's value supports the loan amount.

**If appraisal comes in low:**
- Negotiate with seller to lower price
- Bring additional cash to closing
- Challenge the appraisal with comparable sales
- Walk away (if you have appraisal contingency)

## Final Month Before Closing

### 12. Finalize Your Mortgage

**Stay in close contact with your lender:**
- Respond quickly to document requests
- Don't make large purchases
- Don't change jobs
- Don't open new credit accounts
- Keep your finances stable

### 13. Get Homeowners Insurance

**Houston-specific considerations:**
- Wind/hail coverage (separate from standard policy)
- Flood insurance (if in flood zone or recommended)
- Higher premiums due to hurricane risk
- Deductibles (often percentage-based for wind/hail)

**Shop around:** Rates vary significantly between insurers.

### 14. Final Walkthrough

24-48 hours before closing, do a final walkthrough to ensure:
- Agreed-upon repairs were completed
- Property is in same condition as when you made offer
- All fixtures and appliances included in sale are present
- No new damage has occurred

## Closing Day

### 15. Review Closing Disclosure

You'll receive this at least 3 days before closing. Review carefully:
- Loan terms match what you agreed to
- Closing costs are accurate
- No unexpected fees

### 16. Bring Required Items to Closing

- Photo ID
- Cashier's check or wire transfer confirmation for closing costs
- Proof of homeowners insurance
- Any additional documents your lender requires

### 17. Sign Documents and Get Your Keys!

You'll sign numerous documents including:
- Promissory note
- Deed of trust
- Closing disclosure
- Title documents
- HOA documents (if applicable)

**Congratulations – you're now a Houston homeowner!**

## After Closing

- Gas
- Internet/cable
- Trash service

### Change Your Address
- USPS forwarding
- Driver's license
- Voter registration
- Bank accounts
- Subscriptions

### Maintain Your Home
- Change HVAC filters monthly (Houston heat works them hard!)

# Understanding Mortgage Pre-Approval: Your Key to Home Buying Success

Getting pre-approved for a mortgage is one of the most important steps in the home buying process. It tells you exactly how much you can afford, shows sellers you're a serious buyer, and can give you a competitive edge in multiple offer situations. Yet many buyers don't fully understand what pre-approval means or how to get it.

This comprehensive guide explains everything you need to know about mortgage pre-approval, from the application process to how it strengthens your position as a buyer.

## What Is Mortgage Pre-Approval?

Mortgage pre-approval is a lender's conditional commitment to loan you a specific amount of money for a home purchase. It's based on a thorough review of your financial situation, including your income, assets, debts, and credit history.

**A pre-approval letter states:**
- The maximum loan amount you qualify for
- The type of loan program (conventional, FHA, VA, etc.)
- The estimated interest rate
- The expiration date (typically 60-90 days)

**Important:** Pre-approval is conditional and subject to final underwriting, property appraisal, and verification that your financial situation hasn't changed.

## Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval: What's the Difference?

Many buyers confuse these two terms, but they're significantly different.

### Pre-Qualification

**What it is:**
- Informal estimate of how much you might be able to borrow
- Based on self-reported financial information
- No verification of income, assets, or credit
- Can often be done online or over the phone in minutes

**Pros:**
- Quick and easy
- Good starting point for budget planning
- No impact on credit score

**Cons:**
- Not verified or guaranteed
- Carries little weight with sellers
- May not reflect your actual buying power

**Bottom line:** Pre-qualification is a rough estimate, not a commitment.

### Pre-Approval

**What it is:**
- Formal evaluation of your creditworthiness
- Requires documentation and verification
- Lender pulls your credit report
- Underwriter reviews your application
- Results in a conditional commitment letter

**Pros:**
- Shows sellers you're a serious, qualified buyer
- Gives you accurate budget information
- Speeds up the closing process
- Provides negotiating leverage

**Cons:**
- Requires time and documentation
- Results in a hard credit inquiry
- May reveal credit issues that need addressing

**Bottom line:** Pre-approval is a verified commitment that carries real weight.

## Why Pre-Approval Matters

### 1. Know Your True Budget

Pre-approval tells you exactly how much home you can afford based on your actual financial situation, not estimates or online calculators.

**You'll learn:**
- Maximum purchase price
- Estimated monthly payment
- Required down payment
- Closing costs estimate

This prevents you from falling in love with homes outside your budget or, conversely, shopping below your means.

### 2. Strengthen Your Offer

In competitive markets, pre-approval can make or break your offer.

**Sellers prefer pre-approved buyers because:**
- Lower risk of financing falling through
- Faster closing timeline
- Demonstrates seriousness and readiness
- Reduces uncertainty in the transaction

**Real example:** In a multiple offer situation, a seller may choose a pre-approved buyer offering $5,000 less over a non-pre-approved buyer offering more, simply because of the reduced risk.

### 3. Speed Up the Closing Process

Much of the mortgage approval work is already done during pre-approval.

**This means:**
- Faster processing after offer acceptance
- Fewer surprises during underwriting
- Smoother path to closing
- Less stress for everyone involved

### 4. Identify and Fix Issues Early

Pre-approval reveals any credit, income, or documentation issues before you start house hunting.

**Common issues discovered:**
- Credit report errors
- Insufficient income documentation
- High debt-to-income ratio
- Undisclosed debts
- Employment gaps

Finding these early gives you time to address them before making an offer.

### 5. Lock in Interest Rates (Sometimes)

Some lenders offer rate locks with pre-approval, protecting you from rate increases while you shop for homes.

**Rate lock benefits:**
- Protection from rising rates
- Budget certainty
- Peace of mind

**Note:** Not all lenders offer this, and locks typically last 30-60 days.

## The Pre-Approval Process: Step by Step

### Step 1: Choose a Lender

Shop around and compare at least 3 lenders:
- Local mortgage brokers
- Credit unions
- National banks
- Online lenders

**Compare:**
- Interest rates
- Fees and closing costs
- Loan programs offered
- Customer service and responsiveness
- Pre-approval process timeline

### Step 2: Complete the Application

You'll fill out a detailed mortgage application (Form 1003) covering:

**Personal information:**
- Name, address, Social Security number
- Employment history (2 years)
- Current income
- Assets and liabilities

**Property information:**
- Estimated purchase price
- Down payment amount
- Property type and intended use

**Financial details:**
- Bank accounts
- Retirement accounts
- Other assets
- Debts and monthly payments

### Step 3: Provide Documentation

Lenders verify everything you report. Gather these documents:

**Income verification:**
- Last 2 years of tax returns (all pages)
- Last 2 years of W-2s
- Recent pay stubs (last 30 days)
- Year-to-date profit and loss statement (if self-employed)

**Asset verification:**
- Last 2 months of bank statements (all pages)
- Investment account statements
- Retirement account statements
- Gift letter (if using gift funds for down payment)

**Credit authorization:**
- Permission to pull credit report
- Explanation letters for any credit issues

**Employment verification:**
- Contact information for current employer
- Previous employer info (if less than 2 years at current job)

**Additional documents:**
- Photo ID (driver's license or passport)
- Divorce decree (if applicable)
- Bankruptcy discharge papers (if applicable)

### Step 4: Credit Check

The lender pulls your credit report from all three bureaus (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion).

**They're looking at:**
- Credit score
- Payment history
- Credit utilization
- Length of credit history
- Recent credit inquiries
- Public records (bankruptcies, liens, judgments)

**Credit score impact:**
- Hard inquiry may lower score by 5-10 points temporarily
- Multiple mortgage inquiries within 45 days count as one
- Score typically recovers within a few months

### Step 5: Underwriter Review

A loan underwriter reviews your application and documentation to determine:
- Can you afford the loan?
- Will you repay the loan?
- Is the loan amount appropriate?

**Underwriter evaluates:**
- Debt-to-income ratio (DTI)
- Loan-to-value ratio (LTV)
- Credit history and score
- Employment stability
- Cash reserves
- Overall financial picture

### Step 6: Receive Pre-Approval Letter

If approved, you'll receive a pre-approval letter stating:
- Approved loan amount
- Loan type and terms
- Expiration date
- Conditions (if any)

**This letter:**
- Can be shown to sellers and agents
- Demonstrates your buying power
- Gives you confidence to make offers

**Timeline:** The entire process typically takes 1-3 business days with complete documentation.

## What Lenders Look For

### 1. Credit Score

**Minimum scores by loan type:**
- Conventional: 620+
- FHA: 580+ (500-579 with 10% down)
- VA: No minimum (lenders typically want 620+)
- USDA: 640+

**Higher scores mean:**
- Better interest rates
- More loan options
- Easier approval

### 2. Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)

DTI compares your monthly debt payments to your gross monthly income.

**Formula:** (Total monthly debts ÷ Gross monthly income) × 100

**Example:**
- Monthly debts: $2,000 (mortgage, car, credit cards, student loans)
- Gross monthly income: $6,000
- DTI: 33%

**Acceptable DTI:**
- Conventional: Up to 43% (sometimes 50%)
- FHA: Up to 43% (sometimes higher with compensating factors)
- VA: No set limit (but typically 41%)

**Lower DTI means:**
- Easier approval
- Higher loan amounts
- Better rates

### 3. Employment and Income

Lenders want to see:
- Stable employment history (2+ years)
- Consistent or increasing income
- Likelihood of continued employment

**Special situations:**
- Self-employed: Need 2 years of tax returns
- Commission/bonus income: Need 2-year history
- Recent job change: May need explanation
- Gaps in employment: May need explanation

### 4. Assets and Reserves

**Down payment:** Must be verified and sourced
**Closing costs:** Additional funds needed
**Reserves:** Some loans require 2-6 months of mortgage payments in savings

**Acceptable sources:**
- Checking/savings accounts
- Investment accounts
- Retirement accounts (with restrictions)
- Gift funds (with proper documentation)

**Red flags:**
- Large recent deposits (must be explained)
- Borrowed down payment funds
- Insufficient seasoning of funds

### 5. Property Type

Pre-approval is for a specific property type:
- Single-family home
- Condo
- Townhouse
- Multi-family (2-4 units)
- Investment property

Changing property types may require new approval.

## How Long Does Pre-Approval Last?

**Typical expiration:** 60-90 days

**Why it expires:**
- Financial situations change
- Credit reports become outdated
- Interest rates fluctuate
- Employment status may change

**Renewal process:**
- Update financial documents
- New credit pull
- Verify employment
- Confirm no major changes

**Pro tip:** Time your pre-approval so it doesn't expire during your house hunt.

## Maintaining Your Pre-Approval

Once pre-approved, protect your status by avoiding these mistakes:

### DON'T:
1. **Change jobs** - Employment changes can derail approval
2. **Make large purchases** - New debts affect your DTI
3. **Open new credit accounts** - Lowers credit score and increases debt
4. **Close credit accounts** - Can hurt credit score
5. **Make large deposits** - Must be sourced and explained
6. **Co-sign loans** - Adds to your debt obligations
7. **Miss payments** - Damages credit score
8. **Increase credit card balances** - Raises DTI and credit utilization

### DO:
1. **Keep working** - Maintain stable employment
2. **Pay bills on time** - Protect your credit score
3. **Save money** - Build reserves for closing
4. **Respond quickly** - Answer lender requests promptly
5. **Keep documents** - Maintain records of income and assets
6. **Communicate changes** - Tell your lender about any financial changes

## From Pre-Approval to Final Approval

Pre-approval is conditional. Final approval requires:

### 1. Property Identified
- Purchase contract signed
- Property address provided

### 2. Appraisal Completed
- Property value verified
- Condition assessed
- Comparable sales reviewed

### 3. Title Search Clear
- No liens or encumbrances
- Clear ownership history
- Title insurance obtained

### 4. Final Verification
- Re-verification of employment
- Updated credit check
- Confirmation of assets
- Review of any changes

### 5. Underwriting Approval
- Final review of complete file
- All conditions satisfied
- Clear to close issued

## Common Pre-Approval Questions

**Q: Does pre-approval guarantee I'll get the loan?**
A: No, it's conditional. Final approval depends on the property, appraisal, and your financial situation remaining stable.

**Q: How much does pre-approval cost?**
A: Most lenders offer free pre-approval. You'll pay for the appraisal and other costs after your offer is accepted.

**Q: Will pre-approval hurt my credit score?**
A: Minimally. The hard inquiry may lower your score by 5-10 points temporarily, but it recovers quickly.

**Q: Can I get pre-approved with multiple lenders?**
A: Yes, and you should! Multiple mortgage inquiries within 45 days count as one for credit scoring purposes.

**Q: What if I'm denied pre-approval?**
A: Ask why and work to address the issues. Common fixes include paying down debt, improving credit, or increasing income.

**Q: Can I get pre-approved before I'm ready to buy?**
A: Yes! It's smart to get pre-approved early to understand your budget and identify any issues.

# How Refinancing Works in Texas: Complete Guide for Homeowners

Refinancing your mortgage can save you thousands of dollars, help you pay off your home faster, or provide cash for major expenses. But refinancing in Texas comes with unique rules and considerations that homeowners need to understand.

This comprehensive guide explains how refinancing works in Texas, when it makes sense, and what you need to know about Texas-specific regulations.

## What Is Mortgage Refinancing?

Refinancing means replacing your existing mortgage with a new loan, typically to:
- Lower your interest rate
- Reduce monthly payments
- Shorten your loan term
- Switch from adjustable to fixed rate (or vice versa)
- Access home equity through cash-out
- Remove private mortgage insurance (PMI)
- Remove a co-borrower

**The process:** You apply for a new loan, which pays off your existing mortgage. You then make payments on the new loan with new terms.

## Types of Refinancing

### 1. Rate-and-Term Refinance

**Purpose:** Change your interest rate or loan term without taking cash out

**Common reasons:**
- Lower interest rate available
- Want to pay off home faster (30-year to 15-year)
- Switch from ARM to fixed rate
- Remove PMI after reaching 20% equity

**Example:**
- Current loan: $300,000 at 7% for 30 years = $1,996/month
- Refinance to: $295,000 at 6% for 30 years = $1,769/month
- Monthly savings: $227
- Annual savings: $2,724

### 2. Cash-Out Refinance

**Purpose:** Access your home equity by borrowing more than you owe

**Common uses:**
- Home improvements
- Debt consolidation
- Investment opportunities
- Major purchases
- Emergency expenses

**Example:**
- Home value: $400,000
- Current mortgage: $250,000
- New loan: $320,000 (80% LTV)
- Cash to you: $70,000 (minus closing costs)

**Important:** Texas has strict cash-out refinance rules (more on this below).

### 3. Streamline Refinance

**Purpose:** Simplified refinancing for government-backed loans

**Types:**
- **FHA Streamline:** For existing FHA loans
- **VA IRRRL:** For existing VA loans
- **USDA Streamline:** For existing USDA loans

**Benefits:**
- Minimal documentation
- No appraisal required (usually)
- Faster processing
- Lower costs

## Texas-Specific Refinancing Rules

Texas has some of the strictest refinancing regulations in the country, designed to protect homeowners from predatory lending.

### Texas Section 50(a)(6) - Cash-Out Refinance Rules

**Key requirements:**

**1. 12-Day Waiting Period**
- Must wait 12 days after application before closing
- Cannot be waived
- Protects borrowers from rushed decisions

**2. Maximum Loan-to-Value (LTV): 80%**
- Can only borrow up to 80% of home's value
- More conservative than other states (often 85-90%)
- Protects homeowners from over-leveraging

**3. Owner-Occupied Only**
- Must be your primary residence or second home
- Cannot cash-out refinance investment properties
- Must occupy within 60 days of closing

**4. One Cash-Out Per Year**
- Can only do one cash-out refinance per 12 months
- Prevents serial refinancing
- Protects home equity

**5. No Prepayment Penalties**
- Lenders cannot charge prepayment penalties
- Can pay off loan early without fees

**6. Closing Cost Restrictions**
- Limited fees allowed
- No points or origination fees over 3%
- Protects from excessive costs

**7. Three-Day Right of Rescission**
- Can cancel within 3 business days after closing
- Additional consumer protection
- Funds don't disburse until rescission period ends

### Texas Section 50(f)(2) - Home Equity Loans

Alternative to cash-out refinance:
- Can borrow up to 80% LTV combined
- Keeps first mortgage in place
- Subject to same Texas protections
- May have higher rates than refinancing

### Rate-and-Term Refinance in Texas

**Good news:** Rate-and-term refinances are NOT subject to Section 50(a)(6) restrictions.

**This means:**
- No 12-day waiting period
- Can exceed 80% LTV (up to 97% with some programs)
- No one-year waiting period
- Standard 3-day rescission only
- More flexible closing costs

**Requirements:**
- New loan amount cannot exceed current balance plus closing costs
- Cannot take cash out (except small amounts for closing costs)

## When Does Refinancing Make Sense?

### 1. Interest Rates Have Dropped

**Rule of thumb:** Refinancing typically makes sense if you can lower your rate by at least 0.75-1%.

**Calculate your break-even point:**
- Closing costs: $5,000
- Monthly savings: $200
- Break-even: 25 months

If you plan to stay in your home longer than the break-even period, refinancing makes sense.

**Example:**
- Current rate: 7%
- New rate: 6%
- Loan amount: $300,000
- Monthly savings: $200
- Closing costs: $5,000
- Break-even: 25 months
- 5-year savings: $12,000 - $5,000 = $7,000 net savings

### 2. You Want to Pay Off Your Home Faster

Refinancing to a shorter term builds equity faster and saves on total interest.

**Example:**
- Current: $300,000 at 6.5% for 30 years
  - Payment: $1,896/month
  - Total interest: $382,633

- Refinance to 15 years at 5.75%:
  - Payment: $2,489/month
  - Total interest: $148,020
  - Interest savings: $234,613

**Consider if:**
- You can afford higher payments
- You're in your peak earning years
- You want to be mortgage-free sooner
- You're approaching retirement

### 3. You Want to Switch Loan Types

**ARM to Fixed:**
- Protect against rising rates
- Get payment certainty
- Peace of mind

**Fixed to ARM:**
- Lower initial rate
- Planning to move soon
- Expect rates to fall

### 4. You Want to Remove PMI

If your home has appreciated or you've paid down your loan, you may have 20% equity.

**PMI costs:**
- Typically 0.5-1% of loan amount annually
- On $300,000 loan: $1,500-$3,000/year

**Refinancing to remove PMI:**
- Must have 20% equity
- New appraisal required
- Closing costs to consider
- Calculate break-even

### 5. You Need Cash for Major Expenses

**Good uses of cash-out refinancing:**
- Home improvements (add value)
- High-interest debt consolidation
- Education expenses
- Medical bills
- Starting a business

**Poor uses:**
- Vacations
- Luxury purchases
- Depreciating assets
- Lifestyle inflation

**Remember:** You're converting unsecured debt to secured debt. Your home is collateral.

### 6. You Want to Remove a Co-Borrower

After divorce or separation, refinancing can remove an ex-spouse from the loan.

**Requirements:**
- Qualify on your own income
- Sufficient credit score
- Adequate debt-to-income ratio
- May need to buy out ex-spouse's equity

## The Texas Refinancing Process

### Step 1: Determine Your Goals

**Ask yourself:**
- Why am I refinancing?
- How long do I plan to stay in this home?
- Can I afford higher payments (if shortening term)?
- Do I need cash out?
- What's my break-even point?

### Step 2: Check Your Credit

**Minimum scores:**
- Conventional: 620+
- FHA: 580+
- VA: No minimum (lenders typically want 620+)

**Higher scores mean:**
- Better interest rates
- More loan options
- Easier approval

**Improve your score:**
- Pay down credit card balances
- Make all payments on time
- Don't open new accounts
- Dispute credit report errors

### Step 3: Determine Your Home's Value

**Options:**
- Online estimates (Zillow, Redfin) - rough idea
- Comparative market analysis from realtor - more accurate
- Professional appraisal - required for refinancing

**Texas cash-out refinance:**
- Maximum 80% LTV
- Example: $400,000 home = $320,000 max loan

**Rate-and-term refinance:**
- Can go up to 97% LTV with some programs
- More flexibility

### Step 4: Shop Multiple Lenders

**Compare at least 3 lenders:**
- Local mortgage brokers
- Credit unions
- National banks
- Online lenders

**Compare:**
- Interest rates
- APR (includes fees)

### Step 7: Home Appraisal

**Appraiser will:**
- Inspect your property
- Compare to recent sales

**Cost:** $400-$600 typically

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks for report

**If appraisal comes in low:**
- May not qualify for desired loan amount
- Can challenge with comparable sales
- May need to bring cash to closing
- Consider different loan program

### Step 8: Underwriting

**Underwriter reviews:**
- Credit history
- Income stability
- Asset verification
- Debt-to-income ratio
- Property value
- Overall risk

**May request:**
- Additional documentation
- Explanation letters
- Updated statements

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks typically

### Step 9: Clear to Close

Once underwriting approves:
- Receive Closing Disclosure (3 days before closing)
- Review all terms and costs
- Schedule closing appointment
- Arrange for funds if needed

**Texas cash-out refinance:**
- 12-day waiting period from application
- 3-day rescission after closing
- Funds available after rescission period

**Rate-and-term refinance:**
- No 12-day waiting period
- 3-day rescission after closing
- Faster process

### Step 10: Closing

**At closing, you'll:**
- Sign loan documents
- Pay closing costs (if not rolled into loan)
- Receive copies of all documents

**After closing:**
- Wait 3 days (rescission period)
- Old loan is paid off
- New loan begins
- Make first payment in 30-45 days

**Total timeline:** 30-45 days typically (longer for Texas cash-out due to 12-day waiting period)
